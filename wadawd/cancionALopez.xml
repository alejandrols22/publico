		<verso>Now and then I think of when we were together</verso>
		<verso>Like when you said you felt so happy you could die</verso>
		<verso>Told myself that you were right for me</verso>
		<verso>But felt so lonely in your company</verso>

		<verso>You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness</verso>
		<verso>Like resignation to the end, always the end</verso>
		<verso>So when we found that we could not make sense</verso>

		<verso>Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing</verso>
		<verso>And I don't even need your love</verso>

		<verso>Have your friends collect your records and then change your number</verso>
		<verso>I guess that I don't need that, though</verso>
